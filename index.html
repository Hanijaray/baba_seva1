    <h1>Hello Angels, Welcome To Our Page!</h1>
    <h2>What do you think about Lord Shiva?</h2>
    <p>We all know Lord Shiva wasn't born as a baby, because no Vedas or Shastras say Shiva was born as a child.</p>
    <h3>Then how did Shiva come to Earth?</h3>
    <h3>Y'all eager to know the answer?</h3>
  </article>

  <article>
    <p>Lord Shiva lives in Parandhamam â€“ what Christians call Paralogam. We all came from that Parandhamam, and Earth is not our original home.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Then who are we?</b></p>
    <p>We are all souls, here to play our roles in the drama of life. We enter bodies and control them. <i>We reside in the center of the forehead â€“ thatâ€™s why we put a bindi even today.</i></p>
    <hr />
    <h3>THE FACT IS: WE ARE SOULS, NOT THE BODY</h3>
    <hr />
  </article>

  <article>
    <h4>I caught one of your thoughts: "<i>Who told you this? ðŸ¤”</i>"</h4>
    <p>ðŸ˜Š As said earlier, Shiva lives in Parandhamam. He is also a soul â€“ the Supreme Soul. He is the father of all souls and also called <b>Param Pita</b> or <b>Paramatma</b>.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Muslims say Allah, Christians say Heavenly Father, Hindus say Shiva (Shivaling).</p>
    <h3>There Is Only One God â€“ He Has Many Names.</h3>
    <p>That Shiva comes from Parandhamam and enters the body of an old man, and teaches us who we are. He named that old person as BRAHMA.</p>

    <p>He says, "We are all souls, not bodies. Being body-conscious leads to sins like <b>lust, anger, attachment, greed, and arrogance</b>."</p>
    <p><i>Please awaken â€“ you are souls, full of LOVE, PEACE, and HAPPINESS."</i></p>
    <h2>When Will Shiva Come?</h2>
    <h3><b>HE ALREADY CAME! ðŸ˜‡</b></h3>
    <p>Lord Shiva comes only at the end of Kaliyug.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There are four Yugas: <b>Satyug, Tretayug, Dvaparyug, and Kaliyug</b> â€“ a total of 5000 years.</p>

  <article>
    <p>The first 2500 years (Satyug and Tretayug) were heavenly. Everyone was in soul-consciousness and lived in peace and love.</p>
    <p>Later in Dvaparyug and Kaliyug, we forgot our soul identity and became body-conscious. This led to sorrow and suffering.</p>
    <p>At the end of Kaliyug, <b>the Lord returns.</b></p>
    <h2>WHY DOES LORD SHIVA COME?</h2>
    <p>He reveals a secret: <b>What happened 5000 years ago is happening again.</b> If you're reading this now, you read it 5000 years ago too!</p>
    <p>Shiva comes every 5000 years. The old Earth must end and the new world begins. <b>Only bodies are destroyed; the soul is eternal.</b></p>
    <p>Itâ€™s been 85 years since Baba came. In a few more years, Satyug will start.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>You carry burdens of bad karma. To escape future sorrow, remember me as a 'STAR IN THE ORANGE-GOLD SKY' (Parandhamam)</b></p>
    <p>Feel yourself as a soul, not a body.</p>
    <br />
    <p>By remembrance, your nature changes, sins are erased, and at Kaliyugâ€™s end â€“ <b>I WILL TAKE YOU TO OUR SWEET HOME â€“ PARANDHAMAM</b></p>
    <p>We return in Satyug to play our roles again. This 5000-year cycle is called one Kalpa.</p>
    <p>Baba has come, is giving this glorious knowledge, and <b>will keep coming</b> every Kalpa.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In this Kalpa, Shiva Baba already came and speaks daily through an elderly soul. His teachings are called <b><i>Murli</i></b>.</p>
  </article>

  <center><h2>Hear Murli By:</h2></center>

  <article>
    <p><b>Wake up at Amritvela (3â€“4am)</b> and remember Baba â€“ He transforms you into an angel.</p>
    <p>Those who read Murli daily and stay in remembrance become divine beings like Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shankar, Ganesha â€“ but actually, <b>those angels are YOU!</b></p>
    <p>At the start of Satyug, only around 9 lakh angels come to Earth from Parandhamam. By the end of Satyug, the population grows.</p>
    <p>Now, we are more than 600 crores. Only those who try can enter Satyug. Others return later in Dvaparyug or Kaliyug of the next Kalpa.</p>
    <p>If you read till here, you are truly an angel soul â€“ because not everyone can grasp this.</p>
    <p><b>Keep trying to stay in soul-consciousness, my beloved brothers and sisters â€“ and youâ€™ll surely become a King or Queen in Satyug. ðŸ‘‘</b></p>
